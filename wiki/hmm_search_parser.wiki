#summary Detects query hits and outputs summary and details for hmm protein domains.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This python program is designed to be used with hmm_search_files. It detects and displays the number of domain match hits for the sequence query. If matches are founds, it Extracts and appends tab-delimited(Excel formatted) domain sequence summary and domain annotations into 2 separate files. Optional arguments exist for custom modification of the output file.

==Input Instructions==

Arguments: 
1 = program 2 = hmm_file 3 = outfile_summary 4_outfile_details

5 = optional input[gh]

*any combination of the following can be entered in any order
*all information written below is assumed for default(no 5) program
*for further details see *options

||g  ||appends query, accession, and description into outfile_summary(into columns 1 and 2)||
||h || provides headers at the top of the file for each of the output files||
